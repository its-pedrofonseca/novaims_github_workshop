Have you seen the new live action of Snow White? If you haven't seen it, make sure you don't! ðŸ˜…
It is one of the worst movies ever with a rating of 1.5 on IMDb and it is worse than a rotten tomato.

With this fiasco in mind, let's try to predict how sucessfull a movie can be with this dataset I found on kaggle 
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?resource=download).
It contains a list of movies with data regarding plot, cast, crew, budget and revenues.
Can we predict the success of a movie?

This file simulates a simple predict problem. Now, the main objetive of this code is to 
analyse diff changes, add files to the staging area, make a commit and push those changes,
so please don't judge this toy example on how simple this analysis will be (weÂ´re in a github workshop!)

Oh no! This code is full of breakpoints and therefore we cannot run it end to end!
If you don't know what breakpoints are, it is like the pause button on your remote, and the code
won't run unless you intruct it - however it is great for debbugging.

In this pratical exercise your main objetive is to remove the breakpoint() sequencially
and running in the terminal at each step with the command (python/python3 pratical/exercise.py).
Make sure you are in the right place, you should be inside the repository in the directory:
( ../novaims_github_workshop )

In the end you should have no breakpoint() functions!!
